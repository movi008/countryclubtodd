										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In contrast with New York City&#8217;s urban atmosphere, the vast majority of the state is dominated by farms, forests, rivers, mountains, and lakes. New York&#8217;s Adirondack Park is the largest state park in the United States. It is larger than the Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic National Parks combined. New York established the first state park in the United States at Niagara Falls in 1885. Niagara Falls, on the Niagara River as it flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, is a popular attraction.</p>
<p>The Hudson River begins at Lake Tear of the Clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining Lakes George or Champlain. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the Richelieu and then the Saint Lawrence Rivers. Four of New York City&#8217;s five boroughs are on three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River: Manhattan Island; Staten Island; and Long Island, which contains Brooklyn and Queens on its western end.</p>
<p>Upstate and downstate are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York State. The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention. Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include the Southern Tier, which often includes the counties along the border with Pennsylvania, and the North Country, which can mean anything from the strip along the Canadian border to everything north of the Mohawk River.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Manhattan, uptown means north (more precisely north-northeast, which is the direction the island and its street grid system is oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage differs from that of most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one way with a few exceptions (14th, 34th and 42nd to name a few). The rule of thumb is odd numbered streets run west while evens run east.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are cracks in the foundation. Nothing structural. Nothing that’s going to threaten the stability of the home, but they’re there. Nooks, crannies and holes through which seeps an invisible threat. Colorless, odorless and undetectable by your average human, it is nonetheless the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.</p>
<p>Radon gas – even the name sounds ominous, evoking images of radiation and nuclear devastation. Radon gas is created when uranium in the soil decays. The gas then seeps through any access point into a home. Common entry points are cracks in the foundation, poorly sealed pipes, drainage or any other loose point. Once in the home, the gas can collect in certain areas – especially basements and other low-lying, closed areas – and build up over time to dangerous levels. The Environmental Protection Agency of the US Government has set a threshold of 4 pico curies per liter as the safe level. As humans are exposed to the gas over a period of years, it can have a significant and detrimental effect.</p>

<p>A modern redrawing of the 1807 version of the Commissioner&#8217;s Grid plan for Manhattan, a few years before it was adopted in 1811. Central Park is absent.</p>
<p>One neighborhood of New York County is contiguous with The Bronx. Marble Hill at one time was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter" title="Image Alignment 580x300" src="https://i2.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg?resize=580%2C300" alt="Image Alignment 580x300" width="580" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-904 alignleft" title="Image Alignment 150x150" src="https://i1.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Image Alignment 150x150" width="150" height="150" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150&#215;150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.</p>
<p>As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we&#8217;ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it&#8217;s thang. Mission accomplished!</p>
<p>And now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-907" title="Image Alignment 1200x400" src="https://i2.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg?resize=1200%2C400" alt="Image Alignment 1200x400" width="1200" height="400" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-905 alignright" title="Image Alignment 300x200" src="https://i1.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Image Alignment 300x200" width="300" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>And now we&#8217;re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there&#8230; Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don&#8217;t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don&#8217;t let anyone else tell you differently.</p>
<p>In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah&#8230; Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.</p>
<p>And just when you thought we were done, we&#8217;re going to do them all over again with captions!</p>
<div id="attachment_906" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-906" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-906  " title="Image Alignment 580x300" src="https://i2.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg?resize=580%2C300" alt="Image Alignment 580x300" width="580" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-906" class="wp-caption-text">Look at 580&#215;300 getting some caption love.</p></div>
<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.</p>
<div id="attachment_904" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-904" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-904  " title="Image Alignment 150x150" src="https://i1.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Image Alignment 150x150" width="150" height="150" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-904" class="wp-caption-text">Itty-bitty caption.</p></div>

<div id="attachment_907" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-907" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-907" title="Image Alignment 1200x400" src="https://i2.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg?resize=1200%2C400" alt="Image Alignment 1200x400" width="1200" height="400" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-907" class="wp-caption-text">Massive image comment for your eyeballs.</p></div>
<p>The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.</p>
<div id="attachment_905" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-905" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-905 " title="Image Alignment 300x200" src="https://i1.wp.com/samplea.wpboheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Image Alignment 300x200" width="300" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-905" class="wp-caption-text">Feels good to be right all the time.</p></div>
<p>And now we&#8217;re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there&#8230; Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don&#8217;t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don&#8217;t let anyone else tell you differently.</p>
<p>In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah&#8230; Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a wrap, yo! You survived the tumultuous waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island from Bronx and the mainland United States. Several small islands are also part of the borough of Manhattan, including Randall&#8217;s Island, Wards Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor. Manhattan Island is 22.7 square miles (59 km2) in area, 13.4 miles (21.6 km) long and 2.3 miles (3.7 km) wide, at its widest (near 14th Street).</p>
<p>Manhattan is loosely divided into Downtown (Lower Manhattan), Midtown (Midtown Manhattan), and Uptown (Upper Manhattan), with Fifth Avenue dividing Manhattan&#8217;s east and west sides. Manhattan Island is bounded by the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east.</p>
<p>The bedrock underlying much of Manhattan is a mica schist known as Manhattan Schist. It is a strong, competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It is well suited for the foundations of tall buildings and the two large concentrations of skyscrapers on the island occur in locations where the formation is close to the surface. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The logo is a rebus borrowed by Milton Glaser from a Montreal radio campaign. CJAD Montreal Quebec Canada ran a campaign entitled &#8220;Montreal, the city with a heart&#8221;. The logo consists of the capital letter I, followed by a red heart symbol (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), below which are the capital letters N and Y, set in a rounded slab serif typeface called American Typewriter.</p>
<p>Glaser expected the campaign to last only a couple months and did the work pro bono. The innovative pop-style icon became a major success and has continued to be sold for years. In the popular mind (though this was not the original intention) the logo has become closely associated with New York City, and the placement of the logo on plain white T-shirts readily sold in the city has widely circulated the appearance of the image, making it a commonly recognized symbol. Glaser&#8217;s original concept sketch and presentation boards were donated by Doyle to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p>
<p>In 1977, William S. Doyle, Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Commerce hired advertising agency Wells Rich Greene to develop a marketing campaign for New York State. Doyle also recruited Milton Glaser, a productive graphic designer to work on the campaign, and created the design based on Wells Rich Greene&#8217;s advertising campaign.</p>
